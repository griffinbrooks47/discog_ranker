# Discog Ranker

Discog Ranker helps music fans create top 10 lists (or any number) for their favorite artists' songs, albums, or playlists. 

The projects algorithm and backend is currently being written in Python. Eventually, discog ranker will be a website written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript via the React library. The backend will likely be written in NodeJS.
